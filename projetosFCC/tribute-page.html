                John von Neumann (/vɒn ˈnɔɪmən/; Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos, pronounced [ˈnɒjmɒn ˈjaːnoʃ ˈlɒjoʃ];
                December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer
                scientist, engineer and polymath. Von Neumann was generally regarded as the foremost mathematician of
                his time[2] and said to be "the last representative of the great mathematicians".[3] He integrated pure
                and applied sciences.

                Von Neumann made major contributions to many fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics,
                functional analysis, ergodic theory, representation theory, operator algebras, geometry, topology, and
                numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics),
                economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating
                machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.

                He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of
                functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular
                automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.

                Von Neumann published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 60 in applied
                mathematics, 20 in physics, and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical
                ones.[4] His last work, an unfinished manuscript written while he was in the hospital, was later
                published in book form as The Computer and the Brain.

                His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. In a
                short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences, he wrote, "The part
                of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in Göttingen in 1926,
                and subsequently in Berlin in 1927–1929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930
                and Princeton 1935–1939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931–1932."[citation needed]

                During World War II, von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project with theoretical physicist Edward
                Teller, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and others, problem-solving key steps in the nuclear physics
                involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb. He developed the mathematical models behind
                the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon and coined the term "kiloton" (of TNT) as
                a measure of the explosive force generated.

                After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy
                Commission, and consulted for organizations including the United States Air Force, the Army's Ballistic
                Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and the Lawrence Livermore National
                Laboratory. As a Hungarian émigré, concerned that the Soviets would achieve nuclear superiority, he
                designed and promoted the policy of mutually assured destruction to limit the arms race.
