<h2>GENERAL</h2>

- Micro services >> Monolithic
- Peer Review
- Refactoring Doesn't work
- Automation >> Manual
- Indetation

<h2>OTHER</h2>
- Minify code

<h2>HTML</h2>
- Use Semantic Elements, istead of just "div"s

<h2>CSS</h2>
- External Css in header, not inline

- Global Defaults
- Page Level Rules (grids, site template types, and so on)
- Components
- Modifiers
- State
- JavaScript-only Rules
- Utilities

<h2>JS</h2>
- Avoid user-agent sniffing and rely on feature detection instead. Browser detection is dangerous and error-prone.
- Avoid using document.write.
- Only run scripts on a page that are needed for that page.
- Don't repeat yourself (i.e. keep your code DRY)
- Do not modify JavaScript core objects .prototype unless you really know what you're doing.
- Use method names that make sense, such as init() or setup() for code that starts things off. Be consistent on your project.
- External Js in footer, not inline

HTML Email
Content Management System Content (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)
Dynamic Content (HTML created or altSered by JavaScript)
Older Websites
